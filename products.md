# Products

You need to create or connect with supplying producer profiles before you can add products.

The following instructions for managing products are broken down according to whether you have: 1\) created a profile for your supplying producer; or 2\) connected with a pre-existing supplying producer profile.

### 1\) I created a profile for my supplying producer

If in the previous step you created a profile for your supplier \(because they were not on the OFN\), you’ll need to also add their products to that profile, before you can stock them in your store. Instructions for doing this are below, under ‘Adding products’.

### 2\) I connected with a pre-existing supplying producer profile.

If your supplying producer already had a profile, you may or may not need to add their product range. If that producer has already added their products, you don’t need to add them again, instead you just need to get their permission to stock their products in your shop \(see previous step\). They’ll then be visible to your when you go to stock your shop \(in[order cycles](http://openfoodnetwork.org/platform/user-guide/hubs-set-up-guide/order-cycles/)\)

If your supplying producer has a profile, but hasn’t added their product range, you’ll need to first get their permission to manage their products and stock them in your shop. Then, the you can add their products according to process below.

## Adding products

To add products click on **Products **on the horizontal blue menu, and then click **+ New Product**.

**Supplier:**Select the enterprise who produces and supplies the product. Remember you’ll only be able to add products to producer profiles which you have created, or if you have been granted permission to manage the products of a pre-existing producer profile.

**Product name: **This is the title of the product which will be displayed in the store.

**Units: **What units is the product sold in? \(g, kg, L… or itme \(bunch, bag, packet\)\)

**Value:** What value of the above units is the product sold in? \( ie 100g, 2L, 1 bunch\)

**Display As:** This field automatically shows you how the units and value fields will display, once you have filled the units and value fields. \(i.e. units = kg, value = 2, Display as = 2kg\)

If you have selected ‘**items**’ as your unit, the **display as** field will change to ‘**item name’**. Fill this in with the type of item it is. \(i.e. jar, bottle, or bunch\)

**Product category: **Select the most appropriate category for this product.

**Price:** Enter the price for the value noted above. Remember, this is the cost price charged by the producer. Mark-ups and fees are added in Enterprise Fees, Shipping Fees and Payment Methods.

**On hand:**State how much/many of this product you have available and ready for sale. Use this field if you want to track your stock /inventory levels. As customers place orders, the stock level will reduce, and when the on hand amount reaches zero, the product will no longer be visible in your shop. If you don’t want to track inventory in this way, click on demand.

**On demand:**If you select this box, it will indicate that this product is always available. This stops the software from tracking inventory levels for products, and instead it will always show that the product is in stock.

**Product description:** This allows you to tell your customers a little bit about this product.

**Photo:** Upload a photo of this product. We strongly recommend that enterprises take clear, accurate images of their products.

**Tax category: **If you would like the price of this product to include GST, select**GST**from the drop-down menu. The producer enterprise must be set to charge GST in the profile settings to do this. If you leave this field blank, or select **none**, or not set the enterprise as being GST registered, the price will not include GST.

Some examples of how to list different types of products, and how these listing will present in your online store are provided below.

Note: For products usually sold by the kg, it’s best to list the product for sale in increments, of 100g or higher, depending on the product. This makes it easier to list and prepare the order.

### Product variants

Note: If you are listing two products which are very similar, but only vary on price, or size, or flavour, it is best to create a ‘variant’ for that product, rather than creating multiple, separate products. For example, if you sell lemons for 60c each, or 5 for $2.50, you can create two variants for your ‘lemons’ product, one for each price/quantity combination. Or you might sell two flavours of lamb sausages, rosemary, or chili. Each flavour should be a ‘variant’ of the general product. Creating product variants is discussed in greater depth [here.](http://openfoodnetwork.org/platform/user-guide/advanced-features/product-variants/)

Once you have completed a product, click **create**, or if you’d like to add more, click **create and add another**.

When you click **create**,  you will be taken to your **Bulk Edit Product **page, where you will see a summary of all of your products.
