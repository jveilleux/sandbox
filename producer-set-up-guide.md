### Steps for creating and editing a producer profile:

2. [Select the ‘type’ of profile you’d like.](/producer-profile-types.md)

    \(the administration side of your new account\).
4. [Update your profile](/your-profile.md)
    on the OFN with your basic information, contact details and pictures.

### Steps for producers selling on the OFN, either as a supplier, or through an online shopfront.

If you have selected to have a profile only account and don’t wish to trade on the OFN you can stop at step 4. If you wish to sell your products as a supplier to other OFN shops, continue to step 5 to add your products, and then you are ready. Producers who have selected to operate their own OFN shopfront should continue with steps 5-11.
